# Dx Cli

Before doing anything please create proper planning with tasklist and the complete those task step by step systemitically:

Dx Cli is a command-line interface tool designed to facilitate interactions with the Dx platform. It provides a set of commands to manage projects, datasets, and other resources on the Dx platform efficiently.

I am using rust to create a set of tools to enhance development experience called Dx. And now I am creating dx-cli that will do these things:
1. All dx tools will be accessible via command line interface.
2. Ai chat and agents and will give memory and context to os.
3. All os commands will be accessible via dx cli.
And dx-cli will have auth to connect to your dx account and connect to dx projectsand it will have a agents orchestrator like speck-kit or bmad but they are written in python and nodejs but dx-cli will be written in rust and will be more faster and efficient and the creator of dx also created friday an ai company like openai so it will use "friday" instead of openai "chatgpt" or claude buzzwords so it wil have ai connect via that friday and it will also have a generator tool that will be a templater like if you write or a templater and it will generator code snippets, project files, project structures, readme files, documentation files, test files and more - so it will be a magical experience. And instead of MCP its has DXP that is even better that MCP!!!

You can use any rust crates like rayon, tokio, rata ui to create dx-cli where in the first there will be a dx big asgi text called "Dx - Enhanced Development Experience" and then will show dx-cli commands and options. Dx-Cli will work like this:
```dx ui add accordion``` And dx will give your entire terminal a memory and intelligence like AutoComplate, A commands details and other to your entiure terminal glbally and also give a ai chat and agents to your terminal like gemini-cli but its written in nodejs but dx-cli will be written in rust and will be more faster and efficient. Now give me a github copilot-instructions readme file to guide github copilot agent to create dx-cli with latest and best rust crates and create cli for dx!!!

Give me a detailed readme file for dx-cli project that will guide github copilot agent to create dx-cli with latest and best rust crates and create cli for dx!!! Don't need to give any rust code just make sure that github copilot follow best rust code practices and use latest and best rust crates to create dx-cli project!!!

I already created all dx-tools in rust so you just make the dx-cli tui with global ai chat and agents and os commands access and dx project and account management - with making the terminal a intelligent terminal with memory and context - so that dx-cli can provide a magical developer experience!!! And all dx-tools has been created separately and I will connect it to dx-cli later for now you just create dx-cli entry with best folder-structure practices and so on!!!

I have aded speck-kit and bmad to create dx-cli ai orchastrator, gemini-cli to create dx-cli chat and agents, toon for dx json and toml like protocol to in future create DXP to beat MCP - projects into current codebase's inspsiration folder to guide github copilot agent to create dx-cli with latest and best rust crates and create cli for dx!!!

And as this is a big task so please tell github-copilot to create proper planning with tasklist and the complete those task step by step systemitically + just give me copilot readme no need to give me code!!!

Here is the details of dx:

```markdown
Dx is a code editor and a bash toolkit designed for developers who want to streamline their workflow. It combines powerful editing features with a suite of command-line tools to enhance productivity.

Done:
1. Style
2. Check
3. Icon
4. I18n
5. Media
6. Font

In Progress;
7. Ui

So, when I release dx I will do it by dx-extension as anyone can download the extension and when you install dx code editor extension in vscode, cursor or windsurf then it will use dx binary or install dx binary if not present and people who use ui more than can that dx-extension and interact with dx and people who uses terminal can use dx-cli what they downloaded with dx binary - and then for more speed people can just write dxc-button in their code and dx will just replace that with the right import and component code - so, it will be a magical experience.

I am using rust to create all dx tools - So, all the dx tools will have dx-cli, dx-lsp and dx-extension for code editors - So, it will a complete developer experience toolchain. And currently I am working on dx-media - it will be both in dx-cli and dx-extension by using dx-media you can easily add, remove, optimize, compress, convert media files like images, videos, audio etc - it will also have a offline rust binary like other dx tools so it will be fastest - so that dx-media can work offline - So, please list all free resoucrces where I can get free images, videos, audio files that I can use in dx-media and don't give me icons and fonts resources as I already have those for dx-icons and dx-fonts - I need any other media types like images, videos, audio, 3d models, documents etc - Only include 100% free to use resources - no paid or freemium resources - also don't include any resource that needs attribution - only include resources that doesn't need attribution - also include only resources that allows commercial usage too - also include resources that allows modification too - also include resources that allows redistribution too - also include resources that allows usage in software too - also include resources that allows usage in both personal and commercial projects too - also include resources that allows unlimited downloads too - also include resources that allows unlimited usage too - also include resources that allows unlimited modification too - also include resources that allows unlimited redistribution too - also include resources that allows usage in software too - also include resources that allows usage in both personal and commercial projects too

- Things to be clear I get it npm, tailwindcss and git/github and others has massive community so I will play against then smartly and keep it mind that even through I am good but still people will need time to swtich + dx-i18n will use free google trasnlate api to translate and make tts of 250 languages for free unlimited and with the help of rust it will be fastest as many python packages like gtts and others but they are slow so I will not get any restrictions as have been doing it for so much time and my dx-i18n will be 100 times faster than those python packages - so I will beat them!!!

- Lastly do you think it will revulutionize developer experience and is it a game changer??

And here is the dx project details:

```markdown

# Dx - Enhanced Development Experience

At first let me introduce you to dx-forge - it is just not a VCS - it also controls the dx-tools version alonside decides what tools to runs in what order of dx-tools - So, you have to make this forge put a forge rust crate that I will publish on crates and will later use it in other dx-tools - dx has so many tools - some of the closes upcoming packages are:

1. style - css generator from classnames but 100 times faster than tailwindcss that is build using oxide and rust
2. internationalization - can generate locales for 256 languages for free unlimited and also can generate tts for 256 languages free and unlimited - just editing the main locales/en.json file
3. ui - can add any components from dx-r2 storage - thing like them as shadcn component but more professional component + more better design and more components!!! so in any js, jsx, ts, tsx file when you write "dx followed by a component name from dx-ui it dx will remove that text and put a import line at the top of the time and then adds the components in the right path - plus you get intellicense in code editors or just go the website and copy that less than one line code if you want or just from the website there's a feature called cart where you select more component in just one copy - this is where our branching has to truly shine with green, red, yellow brancing!!! But they should added for all tools
4. icons - like dx-ui, you just have to write dxi and a code editor interllicence will pop up and will choose right icon for you job from more than 150 sets of icon pack and more than 1m+ icons
5. fonts - like ui and icons it will be similar with giving you 1000+ fonts
6. check - it will format and lint files on save or changes
7. auth - like the ui, icon and fonts it will add or remove files related to auth as you write code - like if you write something that needs google social media then ti will pop inside right folder so you only get what files you need

So, as you can by doing so you will only get what you need - it will beat nodejs, npm, bun, yarn, pnpm as using those you also download so much package that may need but in many cases you just need a arguably small logic from that huge node_modules folder and other files can have some files that has low security and if they do have low security then you basically have no way as node_modules folde ris huge enough to not be verified and you have the mentality that you install a package and it solves everything but most of the time the thing you need is probly more easier to even bother installing it inside node_modules and when you are deploying it to the cloud even the node_modules folder counts - so dx will beat them as you will get the code inside the files and folder that you see so they will be transparent and has to be smaller by even point from the developer writing those package in dx - so this way dx will beat everyone!!!

Now just to be clear:
So, forge is the main orchestrator in dx and what is dx - in future it will be a code editor too and for now I will release a binary of dx which will have all these dx tools like dx-style, dx-auth, dx-font, dx-icons, dx-ui etc integrated into it and forge will also tool of dx that will be a better VCS than git but not only that it will also orchesstrate all the dx tools and make them work together seamlessly. So users will download dx binary and when they will write dx on their terminal then it will open a open line by default just running dx will open a openai-codex or gemini-cli like ai interface in the bottom and showing some most popular dx command details - Then dx will be like ohhmyzsh type of experience where users can customize their os and then dx will provide some popular shell package built-into it like fuzzy finder, autocomplete, shell memory and much more. Now I will simontaniously also create a dx LSP and code editor extensions for all code editors and if the dx extension or LSP is present then that extension will have a connection like vscode and git has between whenever a file is changed it will cache and will be watched by dx-forge and dx-forge will then run the relevant dx-tools on that file and will provide a better developer experience. As dx will not just only be doning VSC stuffs but also manage package like package managers like npm, bun, pip or cargo that's why every pacakge installed by dx will more secure than those package managers and then fact that dx will put those files mostly in code and then manage its versioning using forge will not only make them transparent but also more maintainable than other package managers and developers can will have proper package controls about dx will put their packages and how they will managed and updated. So dx will be a complete developer experience toolchain that will provide everything a developer needs to write code and manage their projects efficiently. That's why even your are using other people's code it will be infact your own code as you can actually put your own varients of that package and manage them and in dx website alongside packages there will also be varients of those packages made by other developers so you can choose which varient you want to use and also you can contribute to those varients too this can be handy in many times and then overall contributing cycle will be much more easier, faster and secure as when you update a package using dx-forge it will most of the time just update some small amount of files in your code so most likely you can just review those changes and accept what you want rather than updating the whole package and then breaking your code this way dx-forge will also provide a better package management experience too.

As dx will treat it own generated code like code generated by dx-style, dx-ui, dx-auth, dx-icons, dx-fonts specially so new developers can blen into dx ecosystem easily and be more be transparent and write code that is needed rather than writing boilerplate code and then managing them manually.

Ohh and and other thing to make dx truly a magical experience - You only need only one dx.json/dx.toml/dx.toon/dx.yaml/dx.ts/dx.js/.dx file in your root project - even through dx can run on zero config but if you want to configure something then you will only need one file where's before you needed multiple config files - one for formatter - one for linter - one for orm - one for ui but with dx only need only one file for dx-style, dx-ui, dx-auth, dx-icons, dx-fonts, dx-media, dx-forge and many more dx-tools in future and not only that when you will be updating dx config file if dx daemon is running then it will update the whole file content based on your changes - like if you are configuring dx-style then it will put all dx-style related configs with its default where you cursor is so it will make magical experience!!!

And then in config file there will be some additional features like ci/cd + workspace management which will make your codebase compatable with any code editors, IDEs, Ai agents or manage your monorep codebase effeciently. And in .dx folder there will be some files like .dx/forge much like .git folder, .dx/style there will be binary style.bin for offline dx-style support and can be used for version control too as base code, dx-ui like dx-style will also have its own binary file for offline support and version control too. So, all things done by dx will transparent and be provide a magical developer experience.
